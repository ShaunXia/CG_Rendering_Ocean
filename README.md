## Description
This is the final project for CSC562. This project include two programs.

1.Simulating Ocean Water with Gerstner-wave in WebGL.

2.Simulating Ocean Water with iFFT in OpenGL.

Since I am not very familar with javascript and there are some performance problem when I implement the first program, also the GLSL version in WebGL is quite old. So I write the iFFT version in C++ with OpenGL.

Third party libraries that I used:
- **GLEW**  Provide OpenGL API in C++
- **GLFW**  Provide UI window
- **GLM**     Matrix calculation for OpenGL
- **FFTW**  Computing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)


## Directions:
- For the WebGL program: 

  I have uploaded my code to github, and the github page link for the Gerstner Ocean is:
 Â https://shaunxia.github.io/CG_Rendering_Ocean/

  __Conrtol:__
  * __A W S D Q E__: Move Camera
  * __H__: hide/show control panel
  * Others can be set through control panel
  
- For the OpenGL program:

  I created the project with Visual Studio 2015 in Windows 10 and the project included all thirh party libraries.
  Also I've compiled a execuatable file "OceanSurface.exe" you can find it in Release folder.
  
  __Control:__
  * __A W S D Q E__: Move Camera
  * __X__: Show wireframe
  * __1,2,3__: Different color sets for ocean and light.
  * __4,5,6__: Different Wind directions
  * __UP/Down__:Hegher/Lower Wave
  * __Left/Right__:+/- Speed
  * __H/M/L__: High/Midium/Low Resolution
